Custom Apps, similar to Extensions, are simply Javascript that will be injected into Spotify, that consists of a page that can be accessed from the sidebar.

## Installing

Custom Apps files can be stored in:

- `CustomApps` folder in Home directory:

| Platform            | Path                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%appdata%\spicetify\CustomApps\`      |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/CustomApps`       |

- `CustomApps` folder in Spicetify executable directory.

If there are 2 Custom Apps with the same name, the extension within the Home directory will be prioritized.

After placing the Custom App file into correct folder, run following command to install it:

```bash
spicetify config custom_apps <file name>
spicetify apply
```

**Note:** Using `config` command to add Custom Apps always append file name to existed extensions list. It does not replace the whole key's value.

## Uninstalling

If you want to remove a custom app from the current list of custom app you can always append a `-` after the file name:

```bash
spicetify config custom_apps <file name>-
spicetify apply
```

## Custom Apps

Inject custom apps to Spotify and access them in left sidebar.  
Add your desired custom app folder names in config, separated them by `|` character.  
Example:

```ini
[AdditionalOptions]
...
custom_apps = reddit|yourownapp
```

App folders can be stored in:

- `CustomApps` folder in Home directory:

| Platform            | Path                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%appdata%\spicetify\CustomApps\`      |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/CustomApps`       |

- `CustomApps` folder in Spicetify executable directory.

If there are 2 apps having same name, app in Home directory is prioritized.
